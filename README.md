# Energy-Bounded Authorship (EBA)

Energy-Bounded Authorship (EBA) is a governance doctrine and control framework that ensures high-compute AI actions remain subject to explicit human authorization, declared energy or compute budgets, and verifiable accountability.

This repository is not a software product.  
It is a regulator-facing governance and evidence repository.

## Purpose

EBA operationalizes meaningful human oversight for AI systems whose energy consumption has material grid, environmental, and societal impact.

It is designed to align with:
- EU AI Act human oversight requirements
- ISO/IEC 42001 accountability and operational controls
- Evidence and audit expectations for high-risk or high-impact AI use

## Repository Structure

- `/policy/` — Machine-enforceable governance controls (YAML / JSON)
- `/regulatory/` — EU AI Act article mappings and annexes
- `/evidence/` — Integrity artifacts (hashes, Bates indices, custody notes)
- `/docs/` — Final, regulator-ready PDF releases only

## Core Principle

Automation may optimize execution.  
Any AI action that executes or publishes without a human authorship checkpoint produces unaccountable output, not strategy.

Millings Layering Method™ (1979–2025 Federal Anchor Chain)Public governance, compliance, and transparency materials for the Millings Layering Method™. This repository is a controlled disclosure mirror; the canonical source of truth remains the notarized MASTER ZIP.
## Scope

This repository contains public-facing governance, compliance, and transparency materials only.

It does not contain:
- proprietary enforcement logic
- numeric authority thresholds
- notarized artifacts
- internal audit logs
- implementation secrets

The canonical source of truth remains the notarized MASTER ZIP referenced above.
